    "short": "The ocean is a vast and mysterious world. It covers more than 70% of the Earth’s surface and is home to countless species, many of which remain undiscovered.",
    "medium": "Oceans play a crucial role in regulating the Earth's climate. They provide oxygen, regulate temperature, and support biodiversity. Yet, they are facing threats from pollution, overfishing, and climate change.",
    "long": "The ocean is not just a source of beauty, but it is also vital for life on Earth. It regulates the planet's climate by absorbing carbon dioxide and heat. Oceans are home to diverse ecosystems that support a vast array of marine life, from the smallest plankton to the largest whales. The depths of the ocean are still largely unexplored, and scientists continue to discover new species and learn more about the role oceans play in maintaining balance on Earth. However, these ecosystems are under threat due to human activities such as pollution, overfishing, and the effects of climate change, which are causing irreversible damage to marine life."
